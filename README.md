## 📝 Overview 📝
A simple web application to predict Insurance Premium, built using Streamlit and deployed on Render.

## 💡 Motivation 💡
As being a Data and ML enthusiast I have tried many different projects related to the subject but what I have realised is that Deploying your machine learning model is a key aspect of every ML and Data science project. Everything thing I had studied or been taught so far in my Data science and ML journey had mostly focused on defining problem statement followed by Data collection and preparation, model building and evaluation process which is of course important for every ML/DS project but what if I want different people to interact with my models, how can I make my model available for end-users? I can't send them jupyter notebooks right!. That's why I wanted to try my hands on complete end-to-end machine learning project.
